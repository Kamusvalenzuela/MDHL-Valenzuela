                        inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair
                        play. Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator
                        or referee whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject
                        to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey

                        IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
                        within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
                        dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams
                        under 12 and older.

                    <h3>COMPETITION FIELDS</h3>
                    <h4>
                        Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum
                        of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or associations
                        participating in the state competition program that are
                        unable to provide a field that meets these minimum
                        requirements must advise the State Competition Board which
                        will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and
                        recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the
                        minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues,
                        districts or associations that are unable to provide an
                        acceptable field may be required to play all their games
                        away.
